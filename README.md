## Solution Proposal:
As for a visually impaired person, he/she may not be able to go through his/her mobile to know about news, weather or movie update, etc. Even for the person who doesnt want to type and search of a term, this project is useful. This project may help to work only by using their voice commands. The AI used here is to get the Top Movies' updates. This AI can even be used for other uses like:
* Translation, 
* Search through voice, 
* Know updates on sports, 
* Weather,
* Shopping,
* News, etc.

## Problem solved:
* Auto scrolling
* Go back on command
* Watch Trailer of a Movie
* Get a movie overview on command
* Know the updates of Movies.

**The start and stop functionality is not appliecable in web, user have to click the alan button to start and stop. By default, the alan button stops automatically after few seconds if the user don't say anything.**

## Tech Stack used:
* React- The framework used.
* Material-ui - For styling the components, grid, etc.
* Alan-Ai - The api used for voice assistant and command.
* TheMoviesDB - The api to get the movie details.
* Vercel - To host the site
